## Introduction

The Smart Plant Monitoring System using ESP8266 is an IoT project designed to help you monitor the health of your plants remotely. By utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller and various sensors, this system provides real-time data on environmental conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, allowing you to ensure your plants are thriving.

## Requirements

### Hardware

To build this project, you'll need the following hardware components:

-   ESP8266-based microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU or ESP-12E)
-   Soil moisture sensor.
-   DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
-   Relay module (if using a water pump)
-   Power supply for ESP8266 (e.g., USB power adapter or battery)
-   Connecting wires and breadboard
-   Water pump (optional for automated watering)
-   Plant pots with soil

### Software

-   Arduino IDE for ESP8266 development
-   Libraries for ESP8266WiFi, LiquidCrystal_I2C, BlynkSimpleEsp8266 and DHT
-   [Blynk IoT](https://blynk.io/) Cloud account.
-   Blynk mobile app.

## Blynk IoT Cloud Integration

-   Create a new account on [Blynk IoT](https://blynk.io/) Cloud.
-   Developer Zone -> My Templates -> Create New Template.
-   Give a name to your template and select the hardware ESP8266.
-   Datastreams -> Add New Datastream.

-   Events -> Add New Event.
    ![Events](/images/exp-1/pir-event.png)
-   Web Dashboard -> Add Widgets.

    	alt={"mobile dashboard"}
    	height={500}
    	width={250}
    />

-   Now go to Devices -> Add New Device -> Select the template you created.
-   Device Info -> Copy the Firmware configuration.

```config
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "************"
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "************"
#define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "*****************************"
```

-   Then replace the above configuration in the code.

    Get the code from [Github](https://github.com/dhiraj512/plant-monitoring-system).

-   Change the WiFi credentials in the code.
-   Upload the code to the ESP8266 microcontroller.

    Anndd... You're done!

    Happy plant monitoring!
