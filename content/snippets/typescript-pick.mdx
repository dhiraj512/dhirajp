If you need to construct a new type based on some properties of an interface you always can get the `Pick` utility type.

```ts
interface MyInterface {
	id: number;
	name: string;
	properties: string[];
}

type MyShortType = Pick<MyInterface, "name" | "id">;
```

Now `MyShortType` only have `name` and `id` properties extracted from `MyInterface`.
