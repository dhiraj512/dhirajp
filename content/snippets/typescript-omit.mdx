One more useful transformer type as `Pick`, but `Omit` works to "another direction" and excludes properties from the given interface. Let's have a look at the example:

```ts
interface MyInterface {
	id: number;
	name: string;
	properties: string[];
}

type MyShortType = Omit<MyInterface, "name" | "id">;
```

This time `MyShortType` only has `properties` property, because the others are omitted from `MyInterface`.
